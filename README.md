## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before diving into these tutorials, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your computer
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CuriousNeuralNerd/Tutorials.git
   cd Tutorials
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv ml_env
   
   # On Windows
   ml_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source ml_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
